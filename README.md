# Water-Level-Detector-Using-8051-Microcontroller
The estimated amount of water present on this planet is 1.4 billion cubic centimetres, thus a 3 km
layer can be formed on the surface area of the earth to cover the whole planet. The ocean consists of
95% of water but unfortunately there is no usage of the ocean water for human beings. Also 4% of
water stocked in the form of ice.
The micro-controller installed in the system actuates the functionalities of all the components for
supplying water to the water tank when the tank is in empty condition. The relaying switch installed
in it operates in ON/OFF mode.
Whenever the tank is full the micro-controller transmits a command signal for switching OFF the
system. A ‘‘LCD (liquid crystal display)” installed in the system for displaying the level of water in
the water tank. By using of the micro controller PV89V51RD2 (8051) the system is capable of
preventing the overflow of water in a container or in a water tank. The system is further configured
with a water pump controller for controlling the flow of water inside the water tank. Multiple of
sensors also embodied with in the reservoir or the water tank for indicating the plurality levels of
water such as the medium level, high level and low level
